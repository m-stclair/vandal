# vandal

`vandal` provides an visual effect chain GUI for image enhancement and
defacement, optionally including animation via sidechained LFOs. It is very 
fast and has a number of aesthetic capabilities not widely available in other 
software.

Although `vandal` is at working beta status, I make no firm guarantees about
its stability or completeness. This is a recreational project intended for
aesthetic and entertainment purposes. No documentation is available for 
`vandal`, and `vandal` has no self-tests.

A live version is available at: https://m-stclair.github.io/vandal/. Note that 
If accessed from a mobile device, `vandal` runs in "pocket mode", offering preset
and random effect chain _application_, but not _editing_ -- like an animated
"image filter app".

`vandal` bears the BSD 3-Clause License, copyright Michael St. Clair. You can 
do nearly anything you want with this code. Some ancillary shaders bear 
additional licenses (attached as headers to individual files).

Contributions are not solicited at this time. Feel free to file Issues.
