# vandal

`vandal` provides a visual effect chain GUI intended as an image defacement toy.
I make no guarantees that it is not a _broken_ toy: this is a recreational
project. 

`vandal` is pre-alpha but unlikely to delete your computer. No documentation is 
available. 

`vandal` bears the BSD 3-Clause License, copyright Michael St. Clair. You can do
nearly anything you want with this code.
